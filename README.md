# Homeyduino ESP DHT22

This is the first public releas of my code, i will improve this project as it's move along.


This i just a working prototype, im using a LoLin/NodeMCU for the moment.

DHT22 -> ESP
Pin 1 -> VCC
Pin 2 -> D5
Pin 3 -> NC
Pin 4 -> GND
A 4.7k resistor between Pin 1 -> Pin 2

I have a lot of Serial.print and delay at the moment for debuging


  To-Do-List:
 
 * Homey refuses to take float values
 * Sleep for 10-15 min between sensor update
