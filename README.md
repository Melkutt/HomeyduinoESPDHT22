# Homeyduino ESP DHT22

A pritty simple sensor node made by a ESP Î¼C and a DHT22/AM2302 sensor.
The hole ide is to take 5 sampels and thrue them in an array, sort them by size and only send the third number, a.k.a medan value.

(I know, i hate this kinde of circuits examle, but the are easy to read)

* A 4.7k resistor between Pin 1 -> Pin 2
